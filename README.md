## Project Overview
The project aims to build a Convolutional Neural Network from scratch to classify synthetic data. The implementation focuses on understanding the core concepts of CNNs and neural networks.

## File Descriptions
- `ActivationReLU.py`: Implementation of the ReLU activation function.
- `ActivationSoftmax.py`: Implementation of the Softmax activation function.
- `LayerDense.py`: Implementation of a dense (fully connected) layer.
- `LossCategoricalCrossEntropy.py`: Implementation of the categorical cross-entropy loss function.
- `NN.py`: Main script that ties together all components to form the neural network.
- `SyntheticData.py`: Script to generate synthetic data for training.
