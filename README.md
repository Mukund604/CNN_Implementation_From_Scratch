# Spiral Neural Network from Scratch

This repository contains the implementation of a simple neural network from scratch using NumPy. The neural network is designed to classify data points in a spiral pattern. The network consists of a dense layer followed by a ReLU activation function.

## Files

- `DenseLayer.py`: The main script that sets up and runs the neural network.
- `SyntheticData.py`: A module that contains the `spiral_data` function to generate synthetic spiral data for training.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python installed along with NumPy. You can install the required package using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy
